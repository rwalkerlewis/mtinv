<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       sacswapbytes {sac binary files}



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Motorola  and  IBM  processors  (CPU's) were designed to read and write
       bits from left to right like humans but Intel decided  to  do  it  from
       right  to  left (backwards).  This is called computer Endianess... big-
       endian (Motorola/IBM) and little-endian (Intel).  Therefore files writ-
       ten  from  one  type  of processor/computer will need to have its byte-
       order byte-swapped in order for it to be readable on  another  type  of
       computer.   This  includes Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) binary formatted
       files.  This program performs an intelligent  assessment  of  the  file
       type and converts if necessary.  NOTE... if you created sac files using
       rdseed then those sac files inherit the native byte order of that  com-
       puter.   SACSWAPBYTES is only necessary if those files were transferred
       to another type of computer with different  architecture.    Also  note
       that  SAC2000 performs this function automatically but beware that upon
       writing the files over using SAC2000 it inherits the native byte-order.
