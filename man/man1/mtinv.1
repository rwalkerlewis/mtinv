.SH NAME 
mtinv \- moment tensor inversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
mtinv par= mtdegfree=(1,5,6) [no]verbose [no]dumpsac outputpath=[./plotmech] [no]fwd [no]gmtmap 
ts0= fixz= [no]test_mode [no]norm [no]shift ctol= FixISOZ= [no]WgtCovarResid


.SH DESCRIPTION
mtinv reads the same input file used by glib2inv and sacdata2inv to generate processed and filtered
data and Green's function input files and performs an inversion for the 5 or 6 moment tensor elements in a least squares
sense (by Singular Value Decomposition).  The response or fitness of percent double couple and
variance reduction are checked for each source depth and an ASCII formatted E-mail file is generated with the best fit.  A 
postscript plot is also generated with the waveform fit.  Typically sacdata2inv and mtinv can be run inside a C-shell
script looped over origin time values to estimate the optimal origin time and centroid depth.  

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS

.TP
.B par={string}
The file name of the parameter file.  See format of this file below (PARAMETER FILE FORMAT).

.TP
.B mtdegfree={integer=1, 5 or 6}
The number of degrees of freedom for the moment tensor.  If mtdegfree=5 then Mzz is equal to -(Mxx+Myy) and the 
trace of (Mij) is assume zero.  The isotropic component is also assume zero.  When mtdegfree=1 the moment tensor
solution is constrained to be only Misotropic=Mxx=Myy=Mzz while the off diagonal elements are Mxy=Mxz=Myz=0.  When
mtdegfree=6 the solution includes all 6 unqiue elements of the tensor. 

.TP
.B ts0={float}
The number of seconds to shift all of the data relative to the origin time.  The data are shifted within mtinv
and not windowed again by sacdata2inv saving much time.  

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

.TP
.B [no]verbose
Verbosy output for debugging is \fIverbose\fP and for no verbosy output is \fIverbose\fP [optional, default noverbose].

.TP
.B [no]dumpsac
Write out "Dump" the processed data as SAC formatted binary files and synthetics [optional, default nodumpsac].

.TP
.B outputpath=[./plotmech]
This is the path for the plot mechanism files GMT C-shell script and individual solution files for plotting the 
mechanism solution version origin time shift and depth with the mechanism size scaled to the variance reduction
and modulated by the percent double couple.  Default is ./plotmech/

.TP
.B [no]fwd 
Use the EV line in the parameter input file for a forward cacluation of the pure double couple focal mechanism
and moment.  All the plots and output files are made as in the inversion.   Default is inversion mode.  Forward
calculation is off.

.TP
.B [no]gmtmap 
Make a GMT C-shell script that plots a map with the event and station locations.  The solution is also shown.  
mtinv needs to be run with the current best origin time shift that results with the best fitting depth.
Topography can be shown in the map by setting some C-shell environment variables.  Defautl off.

.sp
setenv MTINV_GMT_INT_FILE /my/topography.shade
.sp
setenv MTINV_GMT_CPT_FILE /my/togography.colorpal

.TP
.B fixz= 
Do an inversion with the depth fixed.  Program checks for valid depth.  Default off.

.TP
.B [no]test_mode  
A test mode that forces deviatoric solution.  Default off.

.TP
.B [no]norm  
Distance normalization. Normalizes the data and synthetics.  Defautl is off.

.TP
.B [no]shift  
Shift the data by the maximum of the cross correlation between data and synthetics computed from the best fitting solution.
Default is off.

.TP
.B ctol=  
When the shift option is on, this is the minimum correlation coefficient allowed to shift the data.  If the correlation is
larger than ctol=(0.0 to 1.0) then the data is shifted to the lag time for this maximum correlation.  Default off.

.TP
.B FixISOZ=
Fix the depth of the isotropic Green's functions to the depth specified depth.  This feature allows the assumption 
that isotropic sources are always at the surface.  The program will check to see that it is valid.  Otherwise 
rerun mkgrnlib to include the depth.

.TP
.B [no]WgtCovarResid
Weight the covariance matrix by the variance of the residuals.  Otherwise weight by the variance of the data.
Default off, always weight variance by the data.


.SH PARAMETER FILE FORMAT

.B same format as par file for GLIB2INV(1) and SACDATA2INV(1)

.TP
.B #
A '#' in the first column signifies that the following is a non printing comment
                                                                                                                  
.TP
.B CM
A 'CM ' in columns 1-3 marks the beginning of a comment, typically the region, area, city and country name
for reference purposes only.
                                                                                                                  
.TP
.B OT
A 'OT ' in columns 1-3 is followed by the earthquake origin time string in year/month/day,hour:minute:seconds format, (e.g.,
2005/06/12,15:41:46.000 ).  Origin time is required for setting the origin time in the
synthetics and shifting the observed seismograms in time to improve the fit the synthetics and percent double couple component.
                                                                                                                  
.TP
.B  EV
A 'EV ' in columns 1-3 is followed by six free formatted floating point values:  strike, dip, rake, Mw, event_longitude, event_latitude, and event_depth.  Only event_longitude and event_latitude need to be set for the correct calculation of the source and receiver azimuth and distance.  Should be the same as the \fIevla=\fP and \fIevlo=\fP values used to calculate the Green's function library using "mkgrnlib".  Other values can be set to zero and are only used to forward calculate synthetic ground displacements when the dump option is set (nodumpsac).
